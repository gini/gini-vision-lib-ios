# Swift Example App

The Swift example app provides you with a sample usage of the Gini Vision Library's Screen and Component API written in Swift.

The Gini API SDK for iOS is used for analyzing documents and sending feedback.

Before analyzing documents, you need to set your Gini API Client ID and Client Password in your Environment Variables (`Xcode -> Product -> Scheme -> Edit scheme -> Environment Variables)` as *client_id* and *client_password*, respectively.
