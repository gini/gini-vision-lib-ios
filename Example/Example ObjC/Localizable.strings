 GINI VISION LIBRARY
 ===================
 
 To easily customize texts in the Gini Vision Library overwrite keys by your own definitions.
 For example to change the title of the camera add:
 ```
 "ginivision.navigationbar.camera.title" = "Fotoüberweisung";
 ```
 
 All keys can be found in the `Localizable.strings` file in the Gini Vision Library bundle
 or on [Github](https://github.com/gini/gini-vision-lib-ios/blob/master/GiniVision/Assets/Localizable.strings).
